### Hey ! 👋 Nice to meet you !

print(f"I am {myname} - The Coder Dribbling with Functions")

Welcome to my GitHub world, where coding is as smooth as a Stephen Curry's 3-point shot. Here, life's challenges are tackled with a try {} catch (the ball) {} approach.

### 🧠 Who am I ? A mix of Einstein and Michael Jordan.

<b> Passionate about Sports: </b> As a huge sports fan, especially basketball, I dedicate my free time to analyzing and visualizing sports data, aiming to be the star of the next sports debate.

<b> AI Innovator: </b> Fascinated by AI's potential, I engage in projects leveraging Machine Learning for practical applications, from sports predictions to smart personal assistants.

<b> Creative Developer: </b> I love creating apps that ease daily life while adding a touch of fun. My toolkit includes Python for data analysis and Machine Learning, JavaScript for interactive web apps, and more. My latest project? A tool to predict when my jokes will hit the mark. Spoiler: the results are... variable.

### 🚀 My Projects: A triple-double in Programming, Problem Solving, and Creativity.

### 📬 Contact me - Pass the Ball, Make the Assist of the Year.
